    "description": "The Weed Warden is a low-cost (<$500) weed detection sensor that can be mounted on rovers or tractors. The Weed Warden uses a spectral triad sensor to detect weeds and can then trigger a weed removal system such as a sprayer when weeds are detected.  The system uses the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure the difference between near-infrared (which vegetation strongly reflects) and red light (which vegetation absorbs) to produce a value that ranges from -1 to +1 which will indicate if there is plant life under the sensor.",
